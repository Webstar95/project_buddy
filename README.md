# project_buddy
A voice-controlled AI companion built for builders, designed to integrate with a vehicle’s ECU to redefine diagnostics, tuning, and in-car intelligence.

What started as a simple personal assistant gradually evolved into a vision of integrating AI into my own vehicle build, creating a modern, tech-driven garage experience, inspiring the next generation of builders to learn, experiment, and innovate, fusing technology with hands-on work.

Project Buddy is currently under active development, with modular support for diagnostics, voice interaction, and future ECU-level integrations.
